## Animal - Commandline Test

- Make a new folder named 'Animals'
- Inside of 'Animals' add 2 directories: 'AwesomeAnimals' and 'SketchAnimals'
- Inside of 'AwesomeAnimals' add the following files: 'Capybara.js', 'ArcticFox.html' amd 'TreeFrog.txt'
- Inside of 'SketchAnimals' add the following files: "BrownRecluse.html", "BulletAnt.js"
- Also inside of 'SketchAnimals' create a "Snakes" directory. Snake are extra sketchy.
- Inside 'Snakes' directory create the following files: 'Cobra.css' and 'ReticulatedPython.py'
- You have a change of heart and decide that Bullet Ants are no longer sketchy. Remove the "BulletAnt.js" file.
- All animal life goes extinct. Delete the entire "Animals" directory.

- BOUNUS: See if you can do this without ever chaning directories(without using cd)**
